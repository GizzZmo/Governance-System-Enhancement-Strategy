# This part is crucial for interacting with your package later.

# Example using grep and awk (less robust than jq):

# For example, to get the TotalSystemStake shared object ID:
# TOTAL_SYSTEM_STAKE_ID=$(echo "$PUBLISH_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.objectChanges[] | select(.objectType | contains("::delegation_staking::TotalSystemStake")) | .objectId')
