* Link to a more detailed roadmap document or project board if available.

3. Getting Started (Developer Quick Start)
* 3.1. Prerequisites:
* Sui CLI installed (link to Sui installation guide).
* Move language basics (link to Move book or key resources).
* Git and GitHub familiarity.
* Recommended IDEs (e.g., VS Code with Move Analyzer extension).
* 3.2. Setting up the Development Environment:
* git clone <repository_url>
* cd hybrid-governance
* Instructions for installing any project-specific dependencies (if any beyond Sui).
* 3.3. Building the Code:
* sui move build --path . (or relevant build command from deploy.sh).
* 3.4. Running Tests:
* sui move test --path . (or relevant test command).
* Explanation of different test suites (unit, integration).
* 3.5. Deploying to a Local Testnet/Devnet:
* Simplified instructions based on scripts/deploy.sh.
* How to get test SUI for deployment and interaction.

4. Understanding the Architecture (Module Overview)
* Brief explanation of each core smart contract:
* governance.move: Role in proposal lifecycle, voting.
* delegation_staking.move: Role in stake management, reputation.
* treasury.move: Role in fund management, multi-sig.
* proposal_handler.move: Role in executing proposal actions.
* How they interact (high-level data flow).
* Link to docs/architecture.md (which will contain visual aids).

5. How to Contribute
* 5.1. Finding Issues to Work On:
* Link to the GitHub Issues tab.
* Explanation of labels (e.g., good first issue, bug, enhancement, documentation).
* Encouragement to ask for clarification on issues.
* 5.2. Proposing New Features or Enhancements:
* Process: Open a GitHub Issue first to discuss the idea.
* Template for feature proposals (problem, proposed solution, benefits, potential drawbacks).
* 5.3. Reporting Bugs:
* Process: Open a GitHub Issue.
* Template for bug reports (observed behavior, expected behavior, steps to reproduce, environment).
* 5.4. Coding Standards & Style Guide:
* Adherence to Move language best practices.
* Code commenting conventions (function headers, complex logic).
* Naming conventions.
* Linting (if a linter is used).
* 5.5. Pull Request (PR) Process:

* How to respond to feedback.
* Iteration until PR is approved.
* 5.7. Contributing to Documentation:
