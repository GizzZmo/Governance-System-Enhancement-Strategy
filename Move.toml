# File: Move.toml
# Sui package manifest for the HybridGovernance module.

[package]
name = "HybridGovernance"
version = "0.0.1"
# published-at = "0x..." # Optional: Record the address after publishing. Will be filled by Sui CLI.

[dependencies]
# The Sui framework (which includes MoveStdlib, Sui System, etc.) is typically
# automatically included by the Sui build system.
# Explicitly listing it can lead to duplicate module errors, as seen with 'ecdsa_k1'.
# We are removing the explicit 'Sui = { git = ... }' dependency.
# If you have other specific, non-standard dependencies, list them here.

[addresses]
# This section is used to assign a named address to your package after its first publication.
# This allows modules within the package to refer to each other using this name if necessary,
# especially if a module needs to construct a type from another module using its fully qualified name
# that includes the package's published ID (e.g., hybrid_governance_pkg::governance::Proposal).
#
# For initial development and before the first publish, it's common to set this to "0x0".
# After publishing successfully for the first time, you would replace "0x0" with the actual Package ID
# output by the `sui client publish` command (or your `deploy.sh` script).
hybrid_governance_pkg = "0x0"

# You generally do not need to define 'std = "0x1"' or 'sui = "0x2"' here
# as they are part of the automatically included standard libraries.
# Your code can refer to them directly, e.g., sui::coin::Coin or std::option::Option.
