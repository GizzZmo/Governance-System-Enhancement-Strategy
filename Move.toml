[addresses]
// This section is used to assign a named address to your package after its first publication.
// This allows modules within the package to refer to each other using this name if necessary,
// especially if a module needs to construct a type from another module using its fully qualified name
// that includes the package's published ID.
// For initial development and before the first publish, it's common to set this to "0x0".
// After publishing, you would replace "0x0" with the actual Package ID.
