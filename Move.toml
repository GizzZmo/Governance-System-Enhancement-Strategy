# For specific Sui versions or local development, you might use a local path or a specific git revision/tag:
# Sui = { local = "../path/to/sui/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework" }

[addresses]
# This section is used to assign a named address to your package after its first publication.
# This allows modules within the package to refer to each other using this name if necessary,
# especially if a module needs to construct a type from another module using its fully qualified name
# that includes the package's published ID (e.g., hybrid_governance_pkg::governance::Proposal).
#
# For initial development and before the first publish, it's common to set this to "0x0".
# After publishing successfully for the first time, you would replace "0x0" with the actual Package ID
# output by the `sui client publish` command (or your `deploy.sh` script).
hybrid_governance_pkg = "0x0"
