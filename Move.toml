# File: Move.toml
# Sui package manifest for the HybridGovernance module.

[package]
name = "HybridGovernance"
version = "0.0.1"
# published-at = "0x..." # This will be filled by the Sui CLI after the first successful publish.

[dependencies]
# This section should be EMPTY for standard Sui framework dependencies (Sui, MoveStdlib, SuiSystem, Bridge, DeepBook etc.)
# The Sui build system automatically includes these. Explicitly listing them here can
# cause "Duplicate module" errors.
# Only list other, non-standard Move packages your project depends on here.

[addresses]
# For local development and before the first publish, this section can often be left empty.
# The `hybrid_governance_pkg` name used in your `module hybrid_governance_pkg::module_name`
# declarations will be understood by the compiler for the current, unpublished package.
#
# After the first successful publish, if you need to refer to this package by its
# on-chain ID in other contexts (e.g., other local packages depending on this one by ID,
# or for certain advanced self-referential type constructions), you would then add:
# hybrid_governance_pkg = "0x<ACTUAL_PUBLISHED_ID>"
#
# For now, keeping it empty is the cleanest approach to avoid potential resolution conflicts
# with system-provided addresses.
