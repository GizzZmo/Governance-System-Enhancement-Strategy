        # Workflow Guide
        
        This guide explains the comprehensive GitHub workflow system implemented for the Governance System Enhancement Strategy project.
        
        ## Available Workflows
        
        ### 1. Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline (`comprehensive-ci.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs, manual dispatch
        - **Features**: Matrix builds, code quality checks, security scanning, documentation generation, deployment
        - **Artifacts**: Build artifacts, quality reports, security reports, documentation
        
        ### 2. Security & Vulnerability Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop, daily schedule
        - **Features**: Dependency scanning, Move code analysis, secret scanning
        - **Artifacts**: Security reports, vulnerability assessments
        
        ### 3. Release Automation (`release-automation.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Version tags, manual dispatch
        - **Features**: Changelog generation, release notes, GitHub releases
        - **Artifacts**: Release packages, documentation updates
        
        ### 4. Documentation Generator (`docs-generator.yml`)

        - **Features**: API docs, module docs, diagrams, GitHub Pages publishing
        - **Artifacts**: Generated documentation, diagrams
        
        ### 5. Code Quality & Linting (`code-quality.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Push/PR, daily schedule, manual dispatch
        - **Features**: Move code analysis, style checking, complexity analysis
        - **Artifacts**: Quality reports, style analysis
        
        ### 6. Dependency Management (`dependency-management.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch
        - **Features**: Automated dependency updates, compatibility testing
        - **Artifacts**: Update reports, compatibility analysis
        
        ### 7. Community Engagement (`community-engagement.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Issues, PRs, reviews, weekly schedule
        - **Features**: Auto-labeling, PR analysis, community reports
        - **Artifacts**: Community metrics, engagement reports
        
        ### 8. Performance Testing (`performance-testing.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Code changes, weekly schedule, manual dispatch
        - **Features**: Build benchmarks, test performance, gas analysis
        - **Artifacts**: Performance reports, benchmark comparisons
        
        ### 9. Monitoring & Notifications (`monitoring-notifications.yml`)
        - **Triggers**: Workflow completions, daily health checks
        - **Features**: Health monitoring, failure notifications, status reports
        - **Artifacts**: Health reports, system status
        
        ## Workflow Integration
        
        The workflows are designed to work together:
        
        1. **CI/CD Pipeline** runs on every change
        2. **Security Scanning** provides safety checks
        3. **Quality Analysis** ensures code standards
        4. **Performance Testing** monitors efficiency
        5. **Documentation** keeps docs updated
        6. **Monitoring** tracks system health
        
        ## Manual Workflow Triggers
        
        Most workflows support manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch` with various options:
        
        ```bash
        # Trigger via GitHub CLI
        gh workflow run "Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline" --ref main
        gh workflow run "Security & Vulnerability Scanning" --ref main
        gh workflow run "Release Automation & Changelog Generation" --ref main -f version=v1.0.0
        ```
        
        ## Monitoring Workflow Health
        
        The monitoring workflow provides:
        - Daily health checks
        - Failure notifications
        - Weekly status reports
        - Integration health monitoring
        
        ## Best Practices
        
        1. **Regular Updates**: Keep workflows updated with latest actions
        2. **Security**: Review security scan results promptly
        3. **Performance**: Monitor performance trends over time
        4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
        5. **Community**: Engage with community feedback and contributions
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        Common workflow issues and solutions:
        
        ### Workflow Failures
        1. Check the specific job that failed
        2. Review error logs in the Actions tab
        3. Check for dependency conflicts
        4. Verify secrets are correctly configured
        
        ### Performance Issues
        1. Review performance benchmarks
        2. Check for complexity increases
        3. Consider optimization strategies
        4. Monitor resource usage
        
        ### Security Alerts
        1. Review security scan results
        2. Update dependencies if needed
        3. Address code security issues
        4. Verify secrets are secure

        ```bash
        # Install Sui CLI
        cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --tag "testnet-v1.48.1" sui
        
        # Configure environment
        sui client new-env --alias local --rpc http://localhost:9000
        sui client switch --env local
        
        # Build project
        sui move build --path .
        
        # Run tests
        sui move test --path .
        ```
        
        ### Testnet Deployment
        
        ```bash
        # Switch to testnet
        sui client switch --env testnet
        
        # Deploy contracts
        ./deploy.sh
        ```
        
        ### Automated Deployment
        
        The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys to testnet on:
        - Pushes to main branch
        - Manual workflow dispatch
        - Successful release creation
        
        ## Deployment Process
        
        1. **Build Verification**: Code is built and tested
        2. **Security Checks**: Security scans are performed
        3. **Environment Setup**: Sui client is configured
        4. **Contract Deployment**: Move modules are deployed
        5. **Verification**: Deployment is verified
        6. **Reporting**: Deployment report is generated
        
        ## Monitoring Deployment
        
        - Check GitHub Actions for deployment status
        - Review deployment artifacts
        - Monitor contract addresses and transaction IDs
        - Verify functionality post-deployment
        
        ## Rollback Procedures
        
        If deployment issues occur:
        
        1. Identify the issue from deployment logs
        2. Revert to previous stable version if needed
        3. Fix issues in development
        4. Re-test thoroughly before re-deployment
        
        ## Production Considerations
        
        - Use mainnet for production deployments
        - Implement proper access controls
        - Monitor gas usage and costs
        - Have emergency procedures ready
        - Maintain audit logs
        
        ## Support
        
        For deployment issues:
        - Check the troubleshooting section
        - Review deployment logs
        - Create an issue with deployment details
        - Contact the development team
