## Voting Mechanisms

### Quadratic Voting
**Purpose**: Prevent whale dominance and ensure fair representation

**How it Works**:
- Voting power = √(stake amount)
- Example: 100 SUI = 10 votes, 400 SUI = 20 votes
- Diminishing returns on large stakes
- Encourages broader participation

**Benefits**:
- Fairer voting distribution
- Prevents plutocracy
- Encourages decentralization

### Time-Weighted Voting
**Purpose**: Reward long-term commitment

**How it Works**:
- Bonus multiplier based on staking duration
- Maximum 5x bonus for long-term stakes
- Calculated dynamically at vote time
- Incentivizes holding and participation

**Benefits**:
- Aligns incentives with long-term success
- Reduces short-term manipulation
- Rewards committed community members

### Reputation-Based Voting
**Purpose**: Give additional weight to active, constructive participants

**How it Works**:
- Reputation score builds through activity
- Factors: votes cast, proposals created, quality
- Additional voting weight multiplier
- Decays over time if inactive

**Benefits**:
- Rewards active participation
- Quality over quantity
- Meritocratic element

### Hybrid Calculation
**Formula**: 
```
Final Votes = (√stake × time_bonus) × reputation_factor
```

**Example**:
- Stake: 400 SUI → Base: 20 votes
- 6 months staked → Time bonus: 3x
- Active participation → Reputation: 1.2x
- Final votes: 20 × 3 × 1.2 = 72 votes
