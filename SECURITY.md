Security Policy for Sui Governance Module
Introduction
Security is a paramount concern for the Sui Governance Module. This document outlines the security measures, design considerations, best practices, and procedures related to ensuring the integrity, robustness, and safety of the governance system. Our approach to security is multi-faceted, encompassing secure coding practices, architectural design choices, rigorous testing, planned audits, and community vigilance.
Security Philosophy & Approach
The security of the Sui Governance Module is built upon the following core principles:
Leveraging Sui and Move Language Safety: The system is developed using the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain. Move's design emphasizes resource safety, type safety, and formal verification capabilities, which inherently mitigate many common smart contract vulnerabilities.
Modular Design: Core functionalities are separated into distinct modules (governance.move, delegation_staking.move, treasury.move, proposal_handler.move). This isolation helps limit the potential blast radius of any single vulnerability, simplifies auditing, and allows for more focused security analysis of each component.
Principle of Least Privilege & Capability-Based Access Control: Restricted functions and interactions between modules are governed by a system of Capabilities (e.g., AdminCap, TreasuryAccessCap, ProposalExecutionCap). These objects must be explicitly held and passed to authorize sensitive operations, ensuring that modules and users only have the permissions necessary for their intended actions.
Defense in Depth: Multiple layers of security are employed, including input validation, state consistency checks, event emissions for transparency, and planned external audits.
Transparency: The source code is intended to be open, and key operational data (like treasury balances and proposal states) is publicly verifiable on-chain.
Core Security Features
Capability-Based Security:
AdminCap (in delegation_staking.move): Controls administrative functions like updating minimum validator stake.
TreasuryAdminCap (in treasury.move): Controls treasury configuration like setting multi-sig approver thresholds and managing the approver list.
TreasuryAccessCap (in treasury.move): Required by the proposal_handler.move to authorize funding withdrawals from the treasury as per approved governance proposals.
ProposalExecutionCap (in proposal_handler.move): Required by the governance.move module to trigger the execution logic within the proposal_handler.move, ensuring proposals are only acted upon after passing voting.
Secure Treasury (treasury.move):
Multi-Signature for Direct Withdrawals: Direct withdrawals (not initiated by a governance proposal) require a multi-step process: proposal by an authorized approver, approval by a minimum number of other authorized approvers, and then execution.
Configurable Approver Quorum: The number of approvals needed for direct withdrawals is configurable via governance (using TreasuryAdminCap).
Segregated Funding Path: Governance-approved funding proposals use a separate, capability-gated function (process_approved_funding_by_governance), distinct from the direct multi-sig withdrawal path.
Input Validation & Assertions:
Functions include assert! statements to validate inputs, check state consistency (e.g., proposal not already executed, voting period active/ended), and ensure arithmetic operations are safe (though Move helps prevent overflows/underflows at a language level, explicit checks for sensible values are still good practice).
Checks for positive amounts in financial transactions, valid proposal types, etc.
Event Emission for Auditability:
All significant state changes and actions (e.g., proposal creation, votes cast, proposal execution, fund transfers, admin changes) emit detailed events. This allows for off-chain monitoring, auditing, and verification of system activity.
Protection Against Re-entrancy: Move's ownership model and lack of dynamic dispatch significantly reduce the risk of re-entrancy attacks common in other smart contract languages.
Order of Operations: In critical functions like governance::execute_proposal, the proposal is marked as executed = true before calling external modules (like proposal_handler.move). This prevents re-execution attempts if the external call fails or in complex interaction scenarios.
Smart Contract Audits
Critical Prerequisite: Before any deployment to a mainnet or any environment handling significant value or governing critical protocols, the entire suite of Sui Governance Module smart contracts must undergo one or more comprehensive security audits by reputable third-party firms specializing in smart contract security and, ideally, the Move language.
Scope: Audits should cover:
Identification of all known smart contract vulnerabilities.
Verification of the business logic against the intended design.
Analysis of economic incentives and potential exploits.
Gas optimization and efficiency.
Adherence to Sui and Move best practices.
Correctness of capability management and access control.
Process:
Engage with auditors.
Provide them with the latest stable codebase and comprehensive documentation.
Address all identified issues and vulnerabilities.
Consider a re-audit after significant changes.
Transparency: Audit reports, along with any remediations, should be made publicly available to build community trust.
Known Limitations & Potential Risks
Admin Capability Management: The security of functions protected by AdminCap, TreasuryAdminCap, etc., heavily relies on the secure management of these capability objects. If the private key(s) controlling the address(es) that own these capabilities are compromised, unauthorized administrative actions could occur. These capabilities should ideally be held by a secure multi-sig wallet or a decentralized governance entity itself.
Off-Chain Components: Any off-chain scripts, UIs, or keeper bots used to interact with the governance system must also be secured. Compromise of these components could lead to unintended on-chain actions if they hold keys with permissions.
Complexity of Interactions: While modularity helps, the interactions between modules can still be complex. Thorough integration testing is crucial.
Economic/Governance Attacks:
While quadratic voting and reputation aim to mitigate whale dominance, sophisticated actors could still attempt to manipulate governance outcomes.
Low voter turnout can make it easier for smaller, coordinated groups to pass proposals.
Upgradeability (Future): If the contracts are designed to be upgradable, the upgrade mechanism itself must be extremely secure and likely governed by the system itself.
Cross-Chain Governance (Future): If cross-chain functionality is added, the security of the chosen messaging bridges will become a critical dependency and potential point of failure.
Reporting Vulnerabilities
We take security seriously and encourage the responsible disclosure of any potential vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please report it privately to [Insert Private Security Contact Email or Mechanism - e.g., security@exampledao.org or a Keybase encrypted message].
Please provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it if possible.
Allow a reasonable amount of time for the issue to be assessed and addressed before public disclosure.
A bug bounty program may be established in the future to incentivize responsible disclosure.
Security Best Practices for Users & Integrators
Understand Proposal Implications: Thoroughly review the description and potential impact of any proposal before voting.
Secure Private Keys: Protect the private keys associated with your SUI address, especially if it holds StakedSui objects or administrative capabilities.
Verify Contract Addresses/Package ID: When interacting with the governance system, ensure you are using the official, audited package ID and object IDs.
Monitor Events: For critical systems governed by this module, consider setting up off-chain monitoring of emitted events to track governance activity and treasury movements.
Use Trusted Interfaces: Interact with the governance system through well-vetted and trusted user interfaces or command-line tools.
Capability Transfers: If you are an admin or deployer, handle the transfer of capability objects with extreme care, ensuring they are sent to the correct, secure recipients (e.g., a multi-sig wallet, the governance contract itself if designed to hold them, or a dedicated capability manager).
This security document is a living document and will be updated as the Sui Governance Module evolves.
