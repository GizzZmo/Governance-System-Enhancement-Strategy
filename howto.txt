Absolutely! Let's structure this as a **full blockchain governance module**, including **code organization, file lists, and deployment details**. 🚀

### **📂 Project Structure & File List**
We’ll organize this blockchain governance system into **modular files** for clarity and scalability.

### **📜 Main Governance Contract (governance.rs)**
```rust
module Governance {
    struct Proposal {
        id: u64,
        creator: address,
        description: string,
        proposal_type: u8,
        votes_for: u128,
        votes_against: u128,
        veto_votes: u128,
        quorum: u128,
        executed: bool,
    }

    struct Voter {
        address: address,
        stake: u128,
        delegate: option<address>,
        reputation: u128,
    }

    public fun submit_proposal(creator: address, description: string, proposal_type: u8): u64 {
        let proposal_id = generate_id();
        let quorum = determine_quorum(proposal_type);
        let new_proposal = Proposal { id: proposal_id, creator, description, proposal_type, votes_for: 0, votes_against: 0, veto_votes: 0, quorum, executed: false };
        move_to(creator, new_proposal);
        return proposal_id;
    }

    public fun hybrid_vote(proposal: &mut Proposal, voter: Voter, votes: u128, support: bool, veto: bool) {
        let effective_votes = sqrt(votes);
        let reputation_weight = 100 + voter.reputation / 100;
        let final_votes = effective_votes * reputation_weight / 100;

        let voting_address = voter.delegate.unwrap_or(voter.address);
        assert!(voter.stake >= votes, "Insufficient stake");

        if veto && proposal.proposal_type == 2 {
            proposal.veto_votes += final_votes;
        } else if support {
            proposal.votes_for += final_votes;
        } else {
            proposal.votes_against += final_votes;
        }
    }

    public fun execute_proposal(proposal: &mut Proposal) {
        assert!(proposal.votes_for + proposal.votes_against >= proposal.quorum, "Quorum not met");
        assert!(proposal.votes_for > proposal.votes_against, "Proposal rejected");
        proposal.executed = true;
    }

    fun determine_quorum(proposal_type: u8) -> u128 {
        match proposal_type {
            0 => total_stake * 10 / 100,
            1 => total_stake * 30 / 100,
            2 => total_stake * 50 / 100,
            _ => abort("Invalid proposal type"),
        }
    }

    fun sqrt(x: u128) -> u128 {
        let mut guess = x / 2;
        while guess * guess > x {
            guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2;
        }
        guess
    }
}
```

### **🛠 Deployment Script (deploy.sh)**
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying blockchain governance module..."
cargo build --release
sui move publish --path contracts/governance.rs --gas-budget 1000
sui move publish --path contracts/delegation-staking.rs --gas-budget 1000
sui move publish --path contracts/treasury.rs --gas-budget 1000
echo "Deployment complete!"
```

### **🚀 Next Steps**
We can now:
1️⃣ **Refine Validator Reputation Scoring** – Adjust for bad actors & uptime impact.  
2️⃣ **Add DAO Integration** – Create a decentralized community structure with governance tokens.  
3️⃣ **Implement Treasury AI Audits** – Automate risk assessment for funding proposals.  

Which direction excites you most? Let’s **build this into a fully decentralized governance system!** 🔥
